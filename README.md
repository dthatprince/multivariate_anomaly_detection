# Multivariate Anomaly Detection (Machine Learning Methods)

### Using the UCI Thyroid Disease Data Set

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to multivariate anomaly detection using Python within a Jupyter Notebook. It guides users through loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluating models on the UCI Thyroid Disease dataset.

## Overview

Multivariate anomaly detection is crucial in fields like healthcare, finance, and fraud detection. This tutorial covers three prominent machine learning techniques for detecting anomalies in multivariate data:

- **Isolation Forest**
- **One-Class SVM**
- **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**

Using the UCI Thyroid Disease dataset, this project explores each modelâ€™s capabilities in identifying unusual patterns across multiple variables, aiding early detection of outliers that may indicate anomalies.
